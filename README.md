# CEP-WA2
# 🌌 Solar System Simulation – Field Trip Project

This is an interactive solar system simulation created using **p5.js**, inspired by the "Field Trip" theme. The project is designed to visualize real(ish) physics such as gravitational attraction, orbital mechanics, and the concept of black holes.

## 🪐 Features

- 🌞 A central sun with gravitational pull
- 🌍 User-generated planets that orbit the sun
- ✨ Starry background with two animated glowing stars
- 🕳️ Press `C` or `c` to combine the two stars into a **black hole** that:
  - Attracts planets using inverse-square gravity
  - Swallows up to **5 planets**, then disappears
- 📆 Year counter starting from **2025 AD**, increasing every second
- 🖱️ Click to add new planets at your cursor's position
- 🎓 Clean OOP architecture using multiple JavaScript classes

## 📂 Project Structure


## 💻 Controls

- **Click**: Add a new planet at the mouse position
- **C key**: Trigger star fusion to form a black hole
- **Top Left**: On-screen instructions
- **Top Right**: Live year counter (starting from 2025 AD)

## 🧠 Science Lens

The simulation is inspired by **gravitational physics**, simulating:
- Newtonian orbital mechanics (inverse-square law)
- A black hole-like attractor with strong localized gravity
- Orbital speeds depend on distance from the sun

This is an educational visualization to demonstrate force interactions and dynamic systems.
